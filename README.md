# Metalama.Samples

This repository contains samples for [Metalama](https://www.postsharp.net/), a modern Roslyn-based meta-programming framework to improve your code quality and productivity in C#.

The best way to explore these samples is to use the [Metalama documentation browser](https://doc.metalama.net/examples), where you will also benefit from an online sandbox, so you can try most examples without installing anything on your computer. If you want to go further, you can clone this repository and start hacking.

You will find weird Markdown snippets in this repo, like `[!metalama-file]`. All Markdown files in this repo, except this file, are meant to be compiled by DocFx and our custom extensions. The entry point to build the documentation is the [Metalama.Documentation](https://github.com/postsharp/Metalama.Documentation) repo.

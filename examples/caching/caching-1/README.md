# Caching example: getting started

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

At first glance, caching seems simple. The aspect generates the cache key, performs a cache lookup, and returns the result if it exists. Otherwise, it runs the method and stores the return value in the cache. The following example compares the source code, without caching logic, to the transformed code, with caching logic.

[!metalama-compare Calculator.cs]

## Infrastructure code

The aspect relies on the `ICache` interface, which has only two methods used by the aspect.

[!metalama-file ICache.cs]

A typical implementation of this interface would utilize <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCache>.

## Aspect code

The aspect itself is straightforward:

[!metalama-file CacheAttribute.cs]

As usual, our aspect class inherits the abstract class <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect>, which, in turn, derives from the <xref:System.Attribute?text=System.Attribute> class. This makes `CacheAttribute` a custom attribute. The <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect.OverrideMethod*> method acts like a _template_, with most of its code being injected into the target method, i.e., the method to which we add the `[ReportAndSwallowExceptionsAttribute]` custom attribute. Inside the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect.OverrideMethod*> implementation, the call to `meta.Proceed()` has a unique meaning. When the aspect applies to the target, the call to `meta.Proceed()` stands in for the original implementation, with a few syntactic alterations that capture the return value.

The `CacheKeyBuilder` class hides the complexity of creating the caching key. It is a compile-time class.

[!metalama-file CacheKeyBuilder.cs]

As its name suggests, the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Code.SyntaxBuilders.InterpolatedStringBuilder> class helps build interpolated strings. The `meta.Target` property exposes the context into which the template applies;  `meta.Target.Type` is the current type, `meta.Target.Method` is the current method, and so on. The `GetCachingKey` method creates an interpolated string for the current context. Parameters represent at compile time by the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Code.IParameter> interface. The <xref:Metalama.Framework.Code.IExpression.Value?text=parameter.Value> expression returns a `dynamic` object representing a _run-time_ expression, in this case, the name of the parameter.

Upon receiving the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Code.SyntaxBuilders.InterpolatedStringBuilder> instance from the `CacheKeyBuilder` class, the aspect converts it to a run-time interpolated string by calling the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Code.SyntaxBuilders.ExpressionBuilderExtensions.ToValue*> method. This method returns a `dynamic` object representing the interpolated string, which can be cast to a `string` and used as the caching key.

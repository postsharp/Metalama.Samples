# Singleton example, step 1: Ensuring consistency and avoiding boilerplate

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

To ensure consistency and avoid boilerplate code, we'll turn the `SingletonAttribute` into a Metalama aspect, which will implement the repetitive part of the singleton pattern for us by introducing the `Instance` property (see <xref:introducing-members>), with an initializer that invokes the constructor.

[!metalama-file SingletonAttribute.cs]

The resulting singleton class is a bit simpler:

[!metalama-compare MySingleton.cs]

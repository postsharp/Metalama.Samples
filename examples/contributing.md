# Contributing to Metalama Examples

All examples in this repository are released under an open-source MIT license. If you have built an original aspect, we encourage you to share it with the Metalama community.

Please follow the below procedure:

1. Initiate a discussion with us on [Slack](https://www.postsharp.net/slack) to show us your idea. It's better to have early feedback before investing time and effort.
2. Fork the `Metalama.Samples` repository.
3. Create a subdirectory within the `examples` directory.
4. Create a .NET 6 console project with your aspect, helper classes, and an executable that demonstrates the aspect.
5. Optionally, create an aspect test project under the `examples/tests` directory.
6. Create a `README.md` file that explains the aspect's objective and the most significant elements of the its implementation.
7. Submit a pull request to the `Metalama.Samples` repository.
8. Most of the follow-up will happen on GitHub or through [Slack](https://www.postsharp.net/slack).

We look forward to your contributions!

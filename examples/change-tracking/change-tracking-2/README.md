# Change Tracking example, step 2: verifying manual code

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

In the previous article, we created an aspect that automatically implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IChangeTracking> interface. If the base class has a manual implementation of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IChangeTracking>, the aspect will still work correctly and call the `OnChange` method of the base class. However, what if the base class does _not_ contain an `OnChange` method or if it is not protected? Let's improve the aspect and report an error in these situations.

The result of this aspect will be two new errors:

[!metalama-test ../../tests/Metalama.Samples.ChangeTracking2.Tests/MissingOnChangeMethod.cs]

[!metalama-test ../../tests/Metalama.Samples.ChangeTracking2.Tests/OnChangeMethodNotProtected.cs]

## Aspect implementation

[!metalama-file TrackChangesAttribute.cs]

The first thing we add to the `TrackChangesAttribute` is two static fields to define the errors:

[!metalama-file TrackChangesAttribute.cs member="TrackChangesAttribute._mustHaveOnChangeMethod"]
[!metalama-file TrackChangesAttribute.cs member="TrackChangesAttribute._onChangeMethodMustBeProtected"]

Metalama requires the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Diagnostics.DiagnosticDefinition> to be defined in a static field or property. To learn more about reporting errors, see <xref:diagnostics>.

Then, we add this code to the `BuildAspect` method:

[!metalama-file TrackChangesAttribute.cs marker="BuildAspect"]

As in the previous step, the `BuildAspect` method calls <xref:Metalama.Framework.Advising.IAdviceFactory.ImplementInterface*> with the `Ignore` <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideStrategy>. This time, we inspect the outcome of <xref:Metalama.Framework.Advising.IAdviceFactory.ImplementInterface*>. If the outcome is `Ignored`, it means that the type or any base type already implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IChangeTracking> interface. In this case, we check that the type contains a parameterless method named `OnChange` and verify its accessibility.

## Summary

This article explained how to report an error when the source code does not meet the expectations of the aspect. To make our aspect usable in practice, i.e., to make it possible to enable or disable a hypothetical _Save_ button when the user performs changes in the UI, we still have to integrate with the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> interface and raise the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged> event when the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IChangeTracking.IsChanged> property changes. We will see how to do this in the following article.

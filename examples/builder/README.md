# Implementing the Builder pattern without boilerplate

The popularity of _immutable_ objects has made the Builder pattern crucial in C#. The most frequent use of builders in C# today is to simplify the creation of immutable objects using mutable objects, named _builders_, used solely to create the immutable ones. A prime example is the <xref:System.Collections.Immutable> namespace, where each collection type has its own mutable builder.

Without builders, constructing complex immutable objects can be cumbersome because all properties must be set at once. The Builder pattern allows you to split the object creation process into several steps.

Typically, a builder type would almost be a copy of the corresponding immutable type, with mutable properties instead of read-only ones. An exception to this rule is for properties of _collection_ type. Typically, the immutable type would have properties of other immutable types, while the builder will have properties of mutable types.

A proper implementation of the Builder pattern should exhibit the following features:

* A `Builder` constructor accepting all required properties.
* A writable property in the `Builder` type corresponding to each property of the build type. For properties returning an immutable collection, the property of the `Builder` type should be read-only but return the corresponding _mutable_ collection type.
* A `Builder.Build` method returning the built immutable object.
* The ability to call an optional `Validate` method when an object is built.
* In the source type, a `ToBuilder` method returning a `Builder` initialized with the current values.

To support these features, some implementation details are necessary, such as internal constructors for the source and the `Builder` type.

As you can imagine, implementing the Builder pattern by hand is a tedious and repetitive task. Fortunately, precisely because it is repetitive, it can be automated using a Metalama aspect.

## Alternative

An alternative to the Builder pattern in C# is the use of `record` types, `init` properties, and the `with` keyword. Using vanilla C# is _always_ better than using an aspect if it covers your needs.

However, using records has some limitations:

* If an object must be built in several steps, several instances of a `record` are required (modified in chain with the `with` keyword), while a single `Builder` instance would be necessary in this case.
* Handling collections is more convenient with the Builder pattern.
* It is not possible to validate a `record` before it is made accessible.

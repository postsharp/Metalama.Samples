# Logging Example: Getting started

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

This example is the _Hello, world_ of aspect-oriented programming. We will create an aspect that displays a message when a message starts and completes. 

The following example is trivial and useless in practice, but it's a good point to get started. On the left, you can see the _source_ code, written by a human and stored in the source repository. On the right, you see the _transformed_ code, generated by Metalama based on the aspects. You normally don't see this cod, but this is the one that gets executed at run time. The _green_ code, specifically, is injected by Metalama.

[!metalama-compare Calculator.cs ]

## Implementation

Let's look at the aspect that generates this code:

[!metalama-file LogAttribute.cs]

This aspect is probably the most basic. It has, however, a few points of interest.

The `LogAttribute` class derives from the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect> abstract class, which in turn derives from the <xref:System.Attribute?text=System.Attribute> class. This makes `LogAttribute` a custom attribute.

The `LogAttribute` class implements the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect.OverrideMethod*> method. This method acts like a _template_. Most of the code in this template is injected into the target method, i.e., the method to which we add the `[Log]` custom attribute.

Inside the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect.OverrideMethod*> implementation, the call to `meta.Proceed()` has a very special meaning. When the aspect is applied to the target, the call to `meta.Proceed()` is replaced by the original implementation, with a few syntactic changes to capture the return value.
  
To remind you that `meta.Proceed()` has a special meaning, it is colored differently than the rest of the code. If you use Metalama Tools for Visual Studio, you will also enjoy syntax highlighting in this IDE.

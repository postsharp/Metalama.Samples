# Logging example, step 1: Getting started

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

This example is the _Hello, world_ of aspect-oriented programming. We will create an aspect that displays a message when
a method starts and completes.

The following example is trivial and useless in practice, but it's a good starting point. On the left, you can see the
_source_ code, written by a human and stored in the source repository. On the right, you can see the _transformed_ code
generated by Metalama, based on the aspects. This is the code that gets executed at run time. The _green_ code,
specifically, is injected by Metalama.

[!metalama-compare Calculator.cs]

## Implementation

Let's look at the aspect that generates this code:

[!metalama-file LogAttribute.cs]

This aspect is probably the most basic. It has, however, a few points of interest.

The `LogAttribute` class derives from the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect> abstract class, which,
in turn, derives from the <xref:System.Attribute?text=System.Attribute> class. This makes `LogAttribute` a custom
attribute.

The `LogAttribute` class implements the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect.OverrideMethod*> method.
This method acts as a _template_. Most of the code in this template is injected into the target method, i.e., the method
to which we add the `[Log]` custom attribute.

Inside the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect.OverrideMethod*> implementation, the call
to `meta.Proceed()` has a very special meaning. When the aspect is applied to the target, the call to `meta.Proceed()`
is replaced by the original implementation, with a few syntactic changes to capture the return value.

To remind you that `meta.Proceed()` has a different meaning and configure syntax highlighting in the Metalama Tools for
Visual Studio, the text is colored differently than the rest of the code.

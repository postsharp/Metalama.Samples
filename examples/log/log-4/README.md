# Logging example, step 4: Using ILogger

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

In the preceding steps, we employed the `Console.WriteLine` method to write the trace message. We will now write
messages to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> from the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` namespace, and use
dependency injection to obtain the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger>.

Utilizing dependency injection to obtain an `ILogger` instance, rather than writing directly to `Console.WriteLine`,
provides increased flexibility, maintainability, and testability. This approach enables seamless swapping of logging
implementations, promotes a clean separation of concerns, simplifies configuration management, and allows effective unit
testing by substituting real loggers with mock objects during testing.

Let's examine how the new aspect transforms code.

[!metalama-compare Calculator.cs ]

As shown above, calls to `Console.WriteLine` have been replaced by calls to `_logger.TraceInformation`. There is a
new `ILogger` field, and its value is obtained from the constructor.

## Implementation

Let's now look at the aspect code.

[!metalama-file LogAttribute.cs]

We added some logic to handle the `ILogger` field or property.

The main point of interest in this example is the `_logger` field.
The <xref:Metalama.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IntroduceDependencyAttribute?text=[IntroduceDependency]> custom
attribute specifies that the field must be _introduced_ into the target type unless it already exists, and its value
should be pulled from the constructor. This custom attribute is implemented in
the `Metalama.Extensions.DependencyInjection` package. It supports several dependency injection frameworks. To learn
more about it, see <xref:dependency-injection>.

There are few changes in the `OverrideMethod` method. Instead of `Console.WriteLine`, we use the `ILogger.LogTrace`
method. Note that we need to cast the `InterpolatedStringBuilder.ToValue()` expression into a string, which may seem
redundant because `InterpolatedStringBuilder.ToValue()` returns a `dynamic`. The reason is that `LogTrace` is an
extension method, and extension methods cannot have dynamic arguments. Therefore, we must cast the `dynamic` value into
a `string`, which helps the C# compiler find the correct extension method.

# Examples: exception handling

This section gives several examples of exception-handling aspects:

| Article | Description |
|--------|--------|
| [Retry](retry/README.md) | This series of articles show how to retry the execution of a method when it fails with an exception. Each article adds more features and grows in complexity. It culminates in the integration of Polly. |
| [Enriching exceptions](enrich-exception/README.md) | This article shows how to add the parameter values to the exception object, and create crash reports that are easier to debug.
| [Report and swallow](report-and-swallow/README.md) | This article shows how to build an aspect that reports and swallogs (ignore) last-chance exception, a pattern that is sometimes useful when building plug-ins, at the entry point of the plug-in code. |

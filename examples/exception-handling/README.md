# Examples: exception handling

This section provides several examples of exception-handling aspects:

| Article | Description |
|--------|--------|
| [Retry](retry/README.md) | This series of articles shows how to retry the execution of a method when it fails with an exception. Each article adds more features and grows in complexity, culminating in the integration of Polly. |
| [Enriching Exceptions](enrich-exception/README.md) | This article shows how to add parameter values to the exception object and create crash reports that are easier to debug. |
| [Report and Swallow](report-and-swallow/README.md) | This article shows how to build an aspect that reports and swallows (ignores) last-chance exceptions, a pattern that is sometimes useful when building plug-ins at the entry point of the plug-in code. |

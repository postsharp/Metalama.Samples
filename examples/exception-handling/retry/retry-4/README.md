# Retry Example: Adding logging

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

In this article, we will add real-world logging to the retry aspect. To learn more about logging, please refer to <xref:sample-log>.

Below is the updated code transformation:

[!metalama-compare RemoteCalculator.cs ]

The code now produces the following output:

```
Trying for the 1-th time.
warn: RemoteCalculator[0]
      RemoteCalculator.Add(a = {1}, b = {1}) has failed: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object. Retrying in 200 ms.
trce: RemoteCalculator[0]
      RemoteCalculator.Add(a = {1}, b = {1}): retrying now.
Trying for the 2-th time.
warn: RemoteCalculator[0]
      RemoteCalculator.Add(a = {1}, b = {1}) has failed: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object. Retrying in 400 ms.
trce: RemoteCalculator[0]
      RemoteCalculator.Add(a = {1}, b = {1}): retrying now.
Trying for the 3-th time.
warn: RemoteCalculator[0]
      RemoteCalculator.Add(a = {1}, b = {1}) has failed: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object. Retrying in 800 ms.
trce: RemoteCalculator[0]
      RemoteCalculator.Add(a = {1}, b = {1}): retrying now.
Trying for the 4-th time.
Succeeded
```

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful when including sensitive information (e.g., user credentials, personal data, etc.) in logs as they can pose a security risk. Avoid exposing sensitive data and remove them from logs using techniques such as <xref:sample-log-7>.

## Implementation

To improve logging, we included the method name and parameter values in the logging message using the `LoggingHelper.BuildInterpolatedString` method. For more information about the method, refer to <xref:sample-log-2> and <xref:sample-log-3>.

To substitute `Console.WriteLine` with `ILogger` and inject the `ILogger` into the target class, we used dependency injection. Refer to <xref:sample-log-4> for details.

Below is the aspect code update:

[!metalama-file RetryAttribute.cs ]


We will address any limitations in the next examples.
